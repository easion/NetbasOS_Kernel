1. Quick instructions
=====================

1. Build the standalone SH7045EDK stub (see sh2-704x.c).
2. Make sure the 7045 UPB isn't bypassed (JP2, JP3)
3. Using F-ZTAT on a Windows PC, download gdbstub.out to the EDK
4. Connect with gdb to SCI0 115200bps


2. Detailed Instructions
========================

Build the standalone SH7045EDK stub
-----------------------------------

See the instructions in sh2-704x.c.  You'll want the Motorola S-Record
output file.


Make sure the 7045 UPB isn't bypassed (JP2, JP3)
------------------------------------------------

The stub uses SCI0 to communicate with gdb.  The UPB is connected to
SCI1, and is sometimes bypassed via its JP2 and JP3 jumpers to permit
high-speed (greater than 38400 bps or so, the exact number escapes me)
communications.

You cannot program on-chip flash if the UPB is bypassed.  To set the
UPB back into the non-bypassed configuration, make sure that JP2's and
JP3's pins 1 and 2 are shorted together, and that pins 3 and 4 are
shorted together.  (See Figure 7.4 in the EDK7045F User's Manual for a
clearer description).


Using the Flash utility, download sh2-stub.mot to EDK flash
-----------------------------------------------------------

Requires a Windows PC.  Should be self-explanatory.  Consult section 8
of the EDK7045F User Manual for more information on this if necessary.


Connect with gdb to SCI0, N81 115,200
-------------------------------------

The above numbers are the default speeds and ports.  To change them,
change the definitions for SSR, TDR, RDR, etc. in sh2-704x.c.  If you
find yourself doing this a lot, consider adding a new #define block
for your target.

This is the gdbstubs project.  This project aims to produce
reusable gdb stubs for a variety of embedded architectures
and platforms.

Portions of this code are designed to be reused.  These are all
the files that don't have an architecture- or platform- specific
name, i.e. gdb.c and gdb.h.

To port this code to a new platform or architecture, use an existing
architecture/platform combination as a starting point.  Copy those
files, renaming them as appropriate (use the existing platform
and architecture names in the Cygnus configure script as a guide).

Then start hacking.

For example, if I wanted to port this code to the CPU32 architecture
and a '336 FOOBAR platform (a.k.a. "68336 single board computer",
"evaluation board", "evaluation kit", etc.), and I wanted to use the
Hitachi 704x architecture and 7045edk platform as a starting point, I
would do this:

   cp sh2-704x.c      m68k-cpu32.c
   cp sh2-704x.h      m68k-cpu32.h
   cp sh2-7045edk.c   m68k-cpu32-336FOOBAR.c
   cp sh2-7045edk.h   m68k-cpu32-336FOOBAR.h
   cp sh2-7045edk.cmd m68k-cpu32-336FOOBAR.cmd

Then I would edit all the functions in m68k-cpu32* to make them work.

To be nice, I would also update the Makefile, and create a
README-m68k-cpu32-336FOOBAR.

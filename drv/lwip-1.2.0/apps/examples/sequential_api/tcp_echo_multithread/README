INTRODUCTION
This is an example of  a tcpserver running  in RTLinux.  In this case,
tcpserver  creates a thread   for  each incoming connection, so   many
tcpclients can be inserted at once.

CONFIGURATION 
Modify sources to assign correctly IP addresses and run >make examples
in the directory containing the Makefile.

In the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix are available some  Linux apps to test
tcpserver module.

If you run in RT-Linux the tcpthreaded.o module, in the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix run multiple

>tcpClient <tcpserver_ip> <text>

in other machine to see how they communicate.

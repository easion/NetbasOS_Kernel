INTRODUCTION 
This is an example of a tcpserver and client running both in RTLinux.

CONFIGURATION 
Modify sources to assign correctly IP addresses and run >make examples
in the directory containing the Makefile.

In the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix are available  some Linux apps to test
tcpserver and tcpclient modules.

If    you   run   in   RT-Linux  the    tcpserver.o   module,  in  the
$(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix run

>tcpClient <tcpserver_ip> <text> 

in other machine to see how they communicate.

If  you want  to  run in  RT-Linux  the   tcpclient.o module, in   the
$(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix previously you have to had run

>tcpServer

in another machine.

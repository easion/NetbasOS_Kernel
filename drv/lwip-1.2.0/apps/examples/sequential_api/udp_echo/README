INTRODUCTION
This is an  example of an udpserver   and a udpclient running  both in
RTLinux.

CONFIGURATION
Modify sources to assign correctly IP addresses and run >make examples
in the directory containing the Makefile.

In the $(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix are available some  Linux apps to test
udpserver and udpclient modules.

If  you  run   in     RT-Linux the    udpserver.o  module,     in  the
$(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix run

>udpClient <tcpserver_ip> <text>

in another machine to see how they communicate.

If you want   to  run in  RT-Linux  the  udpclient.o  module,  in  the
$(RTL_LWIP_SOURCES)/unix previously you have to had run

>udpServer

in another machine to see how they communicate.

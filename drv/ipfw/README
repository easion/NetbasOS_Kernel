This directory contains a port of ipfw and dummynet to Linux and OpenWrt
(a Windows version is in the works but not ready yet).
Building the code produces:

	a kernel module,	ipfw_mod.ko
	a userland program,	/sbin/ipfw

The source code here comes straight from FreeBSD (roughly the
version in RELENG_7 and HEAD as of June 2009), plus some glue code
and headers written from scratch.
Unless specified otherwise, all the code here is under a BSD license.

=== To compile for a 2.6 kernel, simply run

	make

    Make sure that kernel headers (or sources) are installed on your
    system, and that the link "/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build" points
    to the header/source tree matching your kernel.

    You can override the default kernel tree with

	make KERNELPATH=your_kernel_source_tree

    NOTE: make sure CONFIG_NETFILTER is enabled in the kernel
    configuration file. You can enable it by doing
    
	"(cd ${KERNELPATH}; make menuconfig)"

    and enabling the option listed below:

        Networking --->
	    Networking options  --->
              [*] Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)


=== To compile for a 2.4 kernel:

	make VER=2.4 KERNELPATH=...

    You need to follow the same instruction for the 2.6 kernel, enabling
    the kernel options:

    Networking options  --->
      [*] Network packet filtering (replaces ipchains)

=== To build an Openwrt package

    (Tested with kamikaze_8.09.1 and Linux 2.4)

    + Download and extract the OpenWrt package, e.g.

	wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.1/kamikaze_8.09.1_source.tar.bz2
	tar xvjf kamikaze_8.09.1_source.tar.bz2

    + "cd" to the directory with the OpenWrt sources (the one that
      contains Config.in, rules.mk ...)

	cd kamikaze_8.09.1

    + Optional: to be sure that the tools are working, make a first
      compilation as follows:

	- run "make menuconfig" and set the correct target device,
	  drivers, and so on;
	- run "make" to do the build

    + Add ipfw2 to the openwrt package, as follows:

      - fetch and extract the code e.g.

	(cd ..; \
	wget http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/dummynet/ipfw_linux-20090724.tgz;\
	tar xvzf ipfw_linux-20090724.tgz; mv ipfw_linux-20090724 ipfw_mod;)

	(but you should have done it already)

      - run the following commands:
	(mkdir package/ipfw2;
	cp ../ipfw_linux/Makefile.openwrt package/ipfw2/Makefile)

	to create the package/ipfw2 directory in the OpenWrt source
	directory, and copy Makefile.openwrt to package/ipfw2/Makefile:

      - if necessary, edit package/ipfw2/Makefile and set IPFW_DIR to point to
	the directory with the ipfw sources (the directory
	which contains this README, dummynet/ ipfw/ and so on);

      - run "make menuconfig" and select ipfw2 as a module <M> in
	    Kernel Modules -> Other modules -> ipfw2

      - run "make" to build the package, "make V=99" for verbose build.

    The resulting package is located in bin/packages/mipsel/kmod-ipfw2*,
    upload the file and install on the target system, as follows:

    opkg install  kmod-ipfw2_2.4.35.4-brcm-2.4-1_mipsel.ipk #install
    ls -l ls -l /lib/modules/2.4.35.4/ipfw*     # check
    insmod /lib/modules/2.4.35.4/ipfw_mod.o     # load the module
    /lib/modules/2.4.35.4/ipfw show             # launch the userspace tool
    rmmod ipfw_mod.o                            # remove the module
